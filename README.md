# Brute-Force Sorting

We talked about the complexity of the sorting problem, and used an argument over
all permutations of a list to be sorted to determine its complexity. Implement
a function to sort a list by systematically trying all permutations of the input
list, using the template in `code.js`. Test your new function; I've provided
some basic testing code that uses [jsverify](https://jsverify.github.io/) in
`code.test.js`.

The return value should be the number of permutations that were tried until the
sorted list was "discovered". The unsorted list passed as an argument should be
sorted, i.e. do not copy the list and sort the copy.

## Runtime Analysis

What is the runtime complexity of the algorithm that you implemented? What does
a best case input for your implementation look like, what does a worst case
input look like? How would this complexity change if you generated permutations
randomly without memory instead of systematically trying them?

Describe your reasoning and the conclusion you've come to. Your reasoning is the
most important part. Add your answer to this markdown file.

Best case runtime: $\Theta (n)$

Worst case runtime: $\Theta (n*n!)$

Reasoning:  In the best case, the array that is given is already sorted, and the checkSorted (time complexity of $\Theta (n)$ because it goes through the entire array) function would run once and the program would end. In the worst case it takes as long as it takes to find the permutation that makes the array sorted, which is a time complexity of $\Theta (n!)$, and after each permutation it needs to run checkSorted which has a time complexity of $\Theta (n)$
